#If everything worked, the generated code will be in the new directory src-gen. The option -sk generates a default implementation of your interface instance in the service.
#Step 5: Write the client and the service application

# Now we can start to write the Hello World application. Create new subdirectories src and build in the project directory and change to src.
# Create src and build directories
cd "$BASEDIR/project" || fail
mkdir src
mkdir build
check_expected build  cgen  fidl  src  src-gen

# Now we have to create 4 files: The client code (HelloWorldClient.cpp), one file for the main-function of the service (HelloWorldService.cpp) and 2 files (header and source) for the implementation of the generated skeleton for the stub (we call it HelloWorldStubImpl.hpp and HelloWorldStubImpl.cpp).

# Let's begin with the client. Create a new file HelloWorldClient.cpp with the editor of your choice and type:

try cp "$BASEDIR/examples/HelloWorldClient.cpp" src/

#At the beginning of each CommonAPI application it is necessary to get a pointer to the generic runtime object. The runtime is necessary to create proxies and stubs. A client application has to call functions of an instance of an interface in the service application. In order to be able to call these functions we must build a proxy for this interface in the client. The interface name is the template parameter of the buildProxy method; furthermore we build the proxy for a certain instance; the instance name is the second parameter in the buildProxy method. In principle there is the possibility to distinguish between instances in different so-call domains (first parameter), but we don't want to discuss this in depth at the moment and take always the domain "local".

#The proxy provides the API function isAvailable; if the we start the service first then isAvailable returns always true. It is also possible to register a callback which is called when the service becomes available; but we try to keep it here as simple as possible.

#Now we call the function sayHello which we have defined in our fidl-file. The function has one in-parameter (string) and one out-parameter (also string). Have a look into HelloWorldPorxy.hpp to get the information how exactly the function sayHello must be called. Here it is important to know that it is possible to call the synchronous variant of this function (what we do here) or to call the asynchronous variant (sayHelloAsync) which is slightly more complicated. One return value is the so-called CallStatus, which gives us the information if the call was successful or not. Again, to keep it simple we do not check the CallStatus and hope that everthing worked fine.

#We continue now to write the service. Create a new file HelloWorldService.cpp:
try cp "$BASEDIR/examples/HelloWorldService.cpp" src/

# The main function of the service is even simpler as the main function of
# the client because the implementation of the interface functions is in
# the stub implementation. Again we need the pointer to the runtime
# environment; then we instantiate our implementation of the stub and
# register this instance of the interface by calling registerService with
# an instance name. The service shall run forever and answer to function
# calls until it becomes killed; therefore we need the while loop at the
# end of the main function.

# At the end we need the stub implementation; we realize it by creating a
# stub-implementation class which is inherited from the stub-default
# implementation. The header file is: 

try cp "$BASEDIR/examples/HelloWorldStubImpl.hpp" src/
try cp "$BASEDIR/examples/HelloWorldStubImpl.cpp" src/

# If the function sayHello is called it gets the name (which is supposed to
# be the name of the developer of this application) and returns it with an
# added "Hello" in front. The return parameter is not directly the string
# as it is defined in the fidl-file; it is a standard function object with
# the return parameters as in-parameters. The reason for this is to provide
# the possibility to answer not synchronously in the implementation of this
# function but to delegate the answer to a different thread.

# Step 6: Build and run

# Since you must have installed CMake in order to build the CommonAPI
# runtime libraries, the fastest way to compile and build our applications
# is to write a simple CMake file. Create a new file CMakeLists.txt
# directly in the project directory: CMakeLists.txt

try cp "$BASEDIR/examples/CMakeLists.txt" .

# As include paths we need the include directories of CommonAPI and bindings and D-Bus; the directory of the generated code must be also added. We link everything together and do not discuss here questions concerning the configuration with different bindings. Therefore we tell CMake where to find the CommonAPI libraries and libdbus (replace the absolute paths with the paths on your machine). At the end we build two executables, one for the service and one for the client.
# Now call CMake (remember that we created the build directory before:
# Build everything
cd "$BASEDIR/project" || fail
cd build || fail
try cmake ..
try make -j4

# Your output should look similiar. In the build direcory there should be two executables now: HelloWorldClient and HelloWorldService.

echo "You may now run $PWD/HelloWorldService &"
echo "and $PWD/HelloWorldClient"
# ./HelloWorldService &
# ./HelloWorldClient
